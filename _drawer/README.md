# 🧰 Kitchen Drawer

This directory contains tools and utilities that we might need for our OpenTelemetry Collector recipes. Think of it as your kitchen drawer, where you keep all those handy tools that make cooking easier!

## 🔧 Contents

The tools in this drawer are used across different recipes in the cookbook. They might include:

- Common configuration snippets
- Shared utilities
- Helper scripts
- Test data generators
- Configuration templates

## 📝 Usage

Each tool in this directory should have its own documentation explaining:
- What it does
- How to use it
- Which recipes depend on it

## 🤝 Contributing

If you have a useful tool that could benefit multiple recipes, feel free to add it to this drawer! Just make sure to:
1. Document its purpose and usage
2. Keep it organized
3. Reference it from the recipes that use it
